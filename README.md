# Code for reinforcement learning, an introduction (Sutton 2016)

This repo contains my code for the book Reinforcement learning, an introduction 2nd edition (draft).

I am currently working through this book to improve my knowledge of rl and working through the examples and experiments is my new experiment in the best way to learn. Publishing this repo publicly is an attempt to keep myself motivated to complete the book and the code.

Some of my code will be messy and terrible and I would love to hear how I can improve them. I will focus on working through the book for now and tidy up the code in the future.

This is a work in progress, the available content are:

1. Chapter 2
2. Chapter 3 and 4
